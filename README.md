# Overview
This is a very basic Tic Tac Toe game made using Django, Python, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This was my first exposure to Django, so the program is fairly minimal in functionality, but it provided a good learning foundation. In order to run the program on MacOS, you need to open a terminal window linked to tictactoe. You need to enter 'python3 manage.py runserver.' If everything is installed correctly, it will show a long message with a line that says 'Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/' Enter that link into your browser and you will be able to use this web app. Note that the game does not stop when someone has three in a row, and you need to refresh the browser to play again.

# Web Pages
This project has two pages, the landing page and the page with the game. The landing page has a title and a button. Clicking the button will take you to the game page. The game page has the tic tac toe board, and you click the button over the space you want to play. Below the tic tac toe board, you will see who goes first. Besides the title and the board, all of the content is dynamically created through Django and Javascript.
